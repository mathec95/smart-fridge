The server.js file is where everything connects. 
The server.js file responds to the users interaction with the webpage and determines which function 
to call. Specific functions results in different results.

In order for the server to work properly, it must be started. This is done using this command:

	node server.js

This command must be done while inside the directory that the server.js file is kept.

Once started, the server will be able to display and/or access any files it needs.
