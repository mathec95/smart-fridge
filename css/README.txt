If you want to add images to the webpage in replacement of the images already on the webpage:

1. Add the image files to this folder.
2. Go into the html file and change the file names found inside the style tags at the 
beginning of the document.
	The file names are under the bgimg-1 and bgimg-2 classes in the background-image attribute. 
	Change the file name inside the url("").
